            With a God, begin to find their purpose and connect with the Mavuno
            Young and Fearless community. Here we intentionally use Mizizi as a
            Discipleship tool and is done through a 10 week amazing éxperience.
            They will also come into a Sunday service where they can connect
            through serving, worship and sermons.

            these young people to fearlessly and boldly take a step and
            influence the community that is around them. In this process they
            become the disciples that Jesus intended them to be.
