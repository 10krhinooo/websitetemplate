      <h2><b>We believe in the father</b></h2>
      <p>
        all-powerful and all-loving God who created all things. We believe that
        all created things belong to and find their purpose in Him
        <b><i>(Genesis 1:1, Psalm 24:1-3)</i></b
        >. Every human being is made in God's image to care for the world on His
        behalf <i><b>(Genesis 1:27-28)</b></i> iand every human culture carries
        His imprint <b><i>(Acts 17:26-28)</i></b
        >. Human rebellion sided with God's enemy and separated the entire
        creation from God <i><b>(Genesis 3)</b></i> and putting creation under
        the control of sin and death. God, who is the definition of love
        <i><b>(1John4:8)</b></i> , is committed to reconciling humanity and all
        creation back to Himself
        <i><b>(Ephesians 1:7-10, 1Corinthians 15:24-8).</b></i> <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2><b>we believe in the son</b></h2>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, who is God's living Word and sacrifice for sin
        <i><b>(Hebrews 10:11-14)</b></i
        >. Through Jesus, God came to planet earth in human form - fully God and
        yet fully human <i><b>(Philippians 2:6-8, Colossians 1:15-20)</b></i
        >. Though tempted in every way, He lived a sinless life
        <i><b>(Hebrews 4:14-16),</b></i> conquering sin and death
        <i><b>(2 Timothy 1:10, Hebrews 2:14, 1 Peter 2:24)</b></i> , so that
        through faith in Him, we who were formerly enemies of God can now be
        reconciled to back to Him <i><b>(Romans 5:10)</b></i> and be restored to
        our role and purpose as God's stewards over creation
        <i><b>(John 1:12-13, 1Peter 2:9)</b></i
        >. Through the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, those
        who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour are guaranteed God's final
        victory over fear, sin, evil, disease and death
        <i><b>(Romans 8:1-2, Revelation 21:4)</b></i> . Further, Jesus is the
        only mediator between us and God
        <i><b>(1Timothy 2:5, John 14:6). </b></i> <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2><b>we believe in the Holy Spirit </b></h2>
      <p>
        Through whom God dwells in every believer
        <i><b>(Corinthians 6:19)</b></i
        >, equipping and directing their everyday living
        <i><b>(John 3:5-6)</b></i
        >, so that believers discover and live out the eternal purpose for which
        God uniquely created them <i><b>(Ephesians 2:10)</b></i
        >. We believe that the Spirit enables believers to communicate with God
        <i><b>(Romans 8:26)</b></i> , to say 'no' to sin
        <i><b>(Romans 6:6-14)</b></i> and to have the character of Jesus
        <i><b>(Galatians 5:28-29)</b></i
        >. The Spirit also gives special supernatural gifts and abilities to
        every believer for the sake of the church
