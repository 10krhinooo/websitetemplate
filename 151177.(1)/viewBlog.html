      <h1>OUR VARIOUS MINISTRIES</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Transit-</b> Previously known as Crossroads. They are between the age
        of 11-13 years at : place of transition between childhood and adult
        hood. <br />
        As a church, we see them being at a transit point in their lives and
        they need a lot of guidance and support.
      </p>

      <h2><b>junior transits:</b></h2>
      <p1>
        Consist of two classes; Year 6&7
        <br />
        <br />
        At the beginning of every year, Mavuno Kids transitions the 10- year old
        to the Preteens Ministry. This is a shared transitional ministry between
        MK and MYF. Mavuno Kids helps (especially with the 11 year old class) in
        settling the kids by lending capacity like facilitators who the kids are
        familiar with for some time. <br />
        The students meet every Sunday. They first go to the MY dome for
        worship, then proceed to their class at 11:00 am at the latest.

      <h3><b>ROPES(transits' final year)</b></h3>
      <p>
        When a child graduates from Mavuno kids the join our youth church which
        is known as Mavuno Young and fearless. In this stage of life they need
        lots of support because they are going through a lot of changes and
        transitions in life and more is expected of them. <br />
        At this stage we help them transition in life through our Preteen
        ministry known as TRANSIT. We have kids from the ages of 11 to 14 years.
        <br />
        In the final year of Transit, the kids go through a one-year program
        which is intentionally designed to initiate the process of transition.
        The program is known as <b>ROPES</b> <br /><b>ROPES</b> meaning is
        "rites of passage" <br />
        In the African setting, it was part of the culture for one to go through
        an initiation process which was designed to help a child transition from
        childhood to adulthood. This program helps do exactly that and more. It
        has a focus on building a good foundation in Godly principles
      </p>
      <h3><b>Objectives</b></h3>
      <li>Transition <br /></li>
      <li>Community <br /></li>
      <li>Discipleship</li>
      <br />
      <h3><b>Transition</b></h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Ropes</b> is for 13 -14 or those in the final year of primary
        education or its equivalent which is determined by the school system
        they are in. <br />
        This helps them to gradually fit in with the other teenagers without
        feeling intimidated as would be the case if they moved straight from
        Mavuno Kids to <b>Mavuno Young & Fearless.</b> <br />
      </p>
      <h3><b>Community</b></h3>
      <p>
        Another objective of the ministry is to foster a sense of community
        among the preteens with the hope that the ties formed during the classes
        will last them through their teen years and into the future.
        Discipleship. <br />
        Besides easing them into the Youth Ministry, the program is also aimed
        at helping the preteens process their transition from childhood into
        teenage (and eventually adulthood) in a godly environment that allows
        them to apply their faith to the issues they face at their age. <br />
        The purpose of the classes is to help the pre-teen grow in their faith
        through lessons and intentional interactions with one another and their
        teachers. <br />
        The ministry is also a discipleship avenue as the students interact with
        people who are older than them and learn from them what it means
        to be a Christian.
